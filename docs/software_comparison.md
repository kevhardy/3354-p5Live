                               SymPy vs p5Live
______________________________________________________________________________________
Introduction:
_____________

  For our project we have chosen p5Live as our live-coding environment tool,
as it is a simplistic and fun way to introduce oneself to the versitile language of Python.

  This document will focus on the key differences as well as the similarities between p5Live
and another live-coding python environment tool: SymPy.

Sympy
_____

SymPy is used primarily as an interactive tool that models simple and highly complicated mathematical models. [1]

It can also be used as an auxiliary tool in addition to another main program in case the need for complicated math arises.[1]



p5 Live
_______

p5 Live is used to create interesting designs and geometric animations in various different ways, and is usually aided by the use 

of Javascript. It can readily be embedded into most web browsers, potentially making it a useful tool for web designers.
