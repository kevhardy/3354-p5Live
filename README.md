[p5](https://github.com/p5py/p5) is a Python module dedicated to providing users an intuitive and functional API for creating interactive graphics and animations in Python.

The design of p5 is based on the Processing language, and while Processing is a wonderful programming language, having the ability to access Python's great writability and readability makes p5 much more conducive for not just learning programming, but also extending their learning process beyond just graphics.

Our goal with p5Live is to give our users the ability to access p5 and the Python programming language without the barriers inherit to installing Python and a dedicated text editor.
This would make the process of learning a programming language, namely, learning Python, a task with no overhead to jump right into.
