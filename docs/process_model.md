Our project will be built on an incremental process model to reflect it's open source development.
Given that the project is hosted on GitHub, we will be able to use GitHub's pull request system to manage bug fixes, patches, and new features.
The users of p5Live will always have the opportunity to post issues on the GitHub repository, and as such, should these issues be the result of a particular patch, these patches can then be easily reversed with the version control offered by GitHub.
However, not all issues will be corresponding to bugs; should any good suggestions or requests from our users be posted in the repository's issues tab, we will work to implement these features into a designated branch that is kept separate from the primary master branch.
Each of these new branches will then implement a linear development process in parallel with the other branches and it is due to this that our project as a whole is represented by the incremental process model.
Therefore, as we collect a number of new branches with these implemented features and have thoroughly tested each one individually, we will subsequently pool these branches together into the master branch to declare a new release of p5Live.
