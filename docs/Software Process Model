On our project p5live, we are using incremental process model. As our project is python module which is dedicated on providing the users an intuitive and functional API for creating interactive graphics and animations in python. We will be designing the project in timely manner, where we will be adding some stuff until our project is working perfectly fine. We will also implement and test the software time by time to check the errors and come up with the solution. The project will be finished when the user get satisfaction with all of its requirements. As in incremental process model, our project combines elements of linear and parallel process flows and also each sequence produces deliverable increments of the software. As we have 4/5 function to editor update the text box and run the code with execution. Then the function console updates the I/O and again we have canvas with render graphics where all of these are from client part. And from the server function which will do the compiling and run the userâ€™s python script and calculate frame where the network must be established between the client and server.
